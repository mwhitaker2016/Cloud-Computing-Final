                                              Cloud Computing Final Project Proposal

            For this final project, we will be attempting to load a Word Press webpage and combine it with the Amazon Polly software. Creating this project will create a site that will allow users to input text and receive a mp3 file that has a chosen voice speaking the text. Many people need this text-to-speech software in order to get through life. Sometimes it can be difficult to read things on small screens. Some people need it to listen to important documents while they are driving. Even blind people rely on text-to-speech for somethings to help them gain the information that they need. Putting the Amazon Polly plug-in on this site, will make it easier to manage and continue to add more features and additions. Word Press is an opens source web publishing software that many people use to create websites or blogs. It powers nearly 30% the web, from small projects to large news sites. Because it is open source and has an extremely flexible management system, it will make it easy to launch and develop the website. While there are many different web accessed text-to-speech software out, like Google Translate, Amazon Polly sounds the most natural. With its different language options, accents, and voice, it enables a user to make their text-to-speech sound a little more personalized. Its service offers an incredibly fast response time, that will make the experience a lot smoother for users. And with the ability to save the file of the speech, users will have convenient access to what they decide to post.
